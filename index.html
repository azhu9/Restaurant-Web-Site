      <p id="description">
        D-Licious Dishes is one of the cleanest, homeliest, and freshest little Diners for dine-in, take-out or
        delivery,
        in Sayreville, NJ. We opened our doors in May of 2021 and have since become known as the Birthplace of the
        Legendary "Honey Garlic Wings"! We pride ourselves in cleaning, seasoning our chicken to the bone, then frying
        it
        up nice and hard, just like you like it!
        We're all about good food, good vibes and a good time, so if you're looking for either, stop by!
        We'd love to meet you in person, but if you can't make it, you can always avail our take-out, delivery and
        catering
        options. Hope to see you soon!
      </p>

It was absolutely amazing. Friendly and welcoming atmosphere she really makes you feel right at home. I will definitely be returning

        <h4 class="review-body">This is the 2nd time we have ordered from D-Licious Dishes and we have loved everything. My fiance is literally obsessed with the mac and cheese (mac and cheese is his fav food in the world and he has made the bold statement that THIS is his fav he's ever had), and the wings are phenomenal. They're big,  cooked perfectly,  and the plain, buffalo, and honey garlic have all been out of this world.  The broccoli is decent, the turkey burger has good flavor, the fries are amaze, and the salad is kind of generic but good portion size for the price.  We'll for sure be frequenting here more often.

        <h4 class="review-body">A hidden treasure, food is fresh & the honey BBQ wings are crunchy, juicy and sticky. My
          first time eating them and they are absolutely my favorite. The honey corn bread is some of the best I‚Äôve had
          in a long time. The baked Macaroni and cheese is creamy and full of flavor. My husband is extremely picky and
          loved every bite. If you are considering ordering or dinning in this place will not disappoint you. Can‚Äôt wait
          to try Fry Fish Fridays.

        <h4 class="review-body">I always love it when I have the chance to stop by for some wings! My suggestion would
          be to call in advance, as they are made to order and will take 20-30 mins. Even if you don't, they are well
          worth the wait! I also enjoy the fish on Fridays!! I definitely recommend this restaurant for those who love
          good food!!
